# llncs-article-template
Latex template for articles that use [LLNCS](https://www.springer.com/computer/lncs/lncs+authors?SGWID=0-40209-0-0-0) document class from [Springer](http://www.springer.com/gp/).

## Requirements
A latex distribution. This will depend on your Operating System. My recommendation for each OS:
* Mac OS: [Mactex](https://tug.org/mactex/)
* Linux: [Tex live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) (You need to check how to install it on your linux distribution)
* Windows: [MikTeX](http://www.howtotex.com/howto/installing-latex-on-windows/)

If you don't want to install anything you can use an online editor, such as:
* [Overleaf](http://www.overleaf.com)

## Get this template
To get this template you can simply fork this repo or just download the files here.

## Compile
To generate the final `article.pdf` file you can use the provided `Makefile` or even with `Grunt`

### Using the Makefile
To be able to use the `Makefile` make sure you have a Unix-like terminal. If you are using Linux or MacOS you alread have what is needed.
On windows, you can simply use [Cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com/).

To compile the final pdf file simply run:
```shell
make
```

To clean all files generated by the compilation process:
```shell
make clean
```

### Using Grunt
If you are familiar with web development and with `NodeJS` you can use `Grunt` to compile your article when you change any file:
Just run:
```shell
grunt
```

It will compile the document and watch for changes in any file.
When you save changes in some `.tex` file, it will compile the document again.

## Usage
After you got all the tools and the template itself, you can start using it.

### Configuration
First, there is some meta-data to configure in your article, such as, `Title`, `Sub title`, `Author's name`, `Author's email` and the `Institution` name.

To change these values, open the `config.tex` file and change the definitions according to what makes sense in your document.

### Sections
To create a new section, simply create a copy of the `template.tex` file inside `sections` folder:
```shell
cp sections/template.tex sections/new_section.tex
```
Replace `new_section` with a file name that makes sense.

Now, this new section will appear somewhere in your article. To add this new section just open the `sections/main.tex` file and include the `sections/new_section.tex` with an `\input{sections/new_section}` statement:
```latex
...
\input{sections/new_section}
...
```

The order in which you write the `\input` statements, defines the order of your sections in the article.

### Figures
To have everything in place, you should put all figures inside `figures` folder and include them in your article.
There is an example of a figure in `figures/rubberduck.jpg` file.
An example of its usage is in `sections/introduction.tex` file:
```latex
\begin{figure}[!ht]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figures/rubberduck}
    \caption{An example of a figure in an article}
    \label{fig:example}
\end{figure}
```

### Bibliography
The bibliography is in `references.bib` file.
Use this file to define your bibliography and place citations in your document with `\cite{label}` statements.
There is an example of a citation in `sections/introduction.tex` file.
```latex
\cite{nobody}
```

### Acronyms
All the acronyms are defined in the `acronyms.tex` file.
To define a new acronym just add a new `\newacronym{label}{short}{complete}` statement.
There is an example of an acronym definition in `acronyms.tex` file:
```latex
...
\newacronym{MA}{MA}{My Acronym}
...
```

There are examples of its usage in `sections/introduction.tex` file:
```latex
An example of usage of an acronym:\\
% Using for the first time
First time: \gls{MA}\\
% Using a second time
Second time: \gls{MA}\\
% Using in plural
Using Plural: \glspl{MA}\\
% Forcing the first time usage
Forcing first time: \glsfirst{MA}
```
