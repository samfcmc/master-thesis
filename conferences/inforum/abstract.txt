Proximity-based applications engage users while they are in proximity
of Points of Interest (POIs). These apps are becoming popular
between the users of mobile devices.
Several technologies can be used.
GPS can be used to locate places outside, where they can pick up
satellite signals.
Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Beacons perform well
indoors. They broadcast an identifier, using
BLE, that mobile
apps can receive and allow them to offer
different possibilities to the users.
Some applications using this technology are emerging, such as advertising
in retailing. However, we can use this technology in other applications
besides in retail. In this paper, we present a solution for ordering food
in restaurants that allows users to order food as soon as they sit interacting
with a mobile app. Restaurants' owners receive the orders and know, immediately,
what the customer wants and which table he has chosen.
