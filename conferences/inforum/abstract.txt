Proximity-based applications engage users
while they are in proximity
of Points of Interest (POIs).
These apps are becoming popular
between the users of mobile devices.
Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Beacons is a
technology
that can be used to locate the user
indoors.
They broadcast an identifier, using
BLE, which allows them to offer
different possibilities to the users.
Some applications using this technology are
emerging, such as advertising
in retailing.
However, we can use it in other
applications
besides in retail.
In this paper, we present a solution for
restaurants that allows customers to
place their orders as soon as they sit
interacting
with a mobile app.
Restaurants' waiters receive the orders and know,
immediately,
what the customer wants and which table they
have to deliver to. We aim to improve the
service avoiding errors, such as to forget
something that the customer asked for, and
allow customers to get their orders faster
without the need to have a waiter to
place their orders.
