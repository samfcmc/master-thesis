In this chapter, we conclude this thesis, outlining the important conclusions of our work, in section \ref{sec:conclusion_contributions} and discussing some of the limitations and future work, in section \ref{sec:conclusion_limitations_and_future_work}.

\section{Contributions}
\label{sec:conclusion_contributions}
A Smart Place is an area with tags, that mobile devices can detect and offer different possibilites, to the users, according to each tag.
In this thesis, we introduced this concept, which we consider a simpler way to look at proximity-based applications.
However, these tags need to be provided by a location technology.
That technology should be compatible with most used smartphones.
We analyzed some location technologies, using a taxonomy\cite{location}, in order to try to find a technology that would be a best fit for our concept of Smart Place.
We chose \gls{BLE} beacons using iBeacon protocol, because it is compatible with any smartphone with Bluetooth version 4.0 or above.
The owners of Smart Places are responsible to place those beacons in the right place.
Users do not need any extra hardware.
They only need to download a single app and turn on the Bluetooth receivers of their mobile devices.

We have created a solution that allows developers, of Smart Places, that provide proximity-based services, using web technologies, such as, \gls{HTML}, \gls{CSS} and Javascript.
With this tool, any web application can react to the presence of tags placed in a given Smart Place.
There is a mobile app, for owners of Smart Places, that they can use to choose which proximity-based services they want to provide and configure the necessary tags.
Another mobile app was developed.
This one is for users, anyone with a mobile device, capable of reacting to tags in a Smart Place.
Using this app, they can have access to any Smart Place, without the need to install one app for each one.

Two examples of Smart Places were created, using our solution, a Smart Restaurant and a Smart Museum.
In the first one, we created the experience of a museum, where visitors can have access to more information, of a piece that they are close to, in a art museum exhibition.
The Smart Restaurant had the goal to allow customers, of a restaurant, to place their orders, after they took a sit, using their mobile devices.
Using this solution, customers do not need to specify which table the orders belong to. Using the tag system, through \gls{BLE} beacons, the app automatically get the table's number and add that information when the customer places the final order.

After the implementation phase, we evaluated the system.
We performed two sets of experiments.
Many times, the mobile apps try to detect the nearest tag.
The library we have used in our mobile apps, have means to get the distance from the detected tags.
The first set of experiments was performed in order to check if this distance value was thrustworthy.
We have reached the conclusion that, if we want to rely on getting the nearest tag, they need to be, at least, 1.5m distant from each other.
The other set of experiments was about battery consumption.
Since our mobile app has a service, running in background, scanning for nearby tags, from time to time, we need to get a good insight about the impact, of that service, in terms of energy.
Users will not use our solution if they run out of battery faster than if they are not using our solution.
For each experiment, we have tried two different types of data connection, using \gls{WiFi} and \gls{3G}.
Using \gls{WiFi} the power drain is almost zero.
However, using \gls{3G}, the power drain was above 2\%, in just one hour.

\section{Limitations and future work}
\label{sec:conclusion_limitations_and_future_work}
% No way to use other technologies for tags
% No interface for owners register beacons
% It only works for web apps... (no integration with native apps)
Our solution tries to target developers, owners and users of Smart Places.
However, it is not perfect.
There are some features that were not implemented. Also, our solution has some limitations that can be improved in the future.

We picked \gls{BLE} as the technology to support tags in a given Smart Place.
Developers that want to use our solution to develop Smart Places, cannot use other technology besides this one.
This technology is a good fit because it allows to build proximity-based services where user interaction is not required, that is, users do not be aware the existence of tags.
In the Smart Museum and Smart Restaurant examples that we have created, the user does not need to open the mobile app.
The mobile device simply shows a notification with the relevant information. The user touches the notification and start interact with the Smart Place.
However, developers might want to build Smart Places that make use of other location technology, such as, \gls{QR} codes or \gls{NFC}.
Our solution is too attached to a particular technology instead of allowing to be extended in order to support more location technologies.

Owners of Smart Places need to deploy tags and use the mobile app to configure those tags.
However, there is not any interface, that they can use, to register themselves, as the owners of such tags.
Unfortunately, anyone can use any tag as if it belongs to him/her.
This can lead to a security problem, which is, people can associate other Smart Places to tags that already support other Smart Place.
People that pass nearby those tags will start to get notifications of Smart Places that were not suppose to get.
A future improvement could be a way of getting tags and register them as beloging to who ordered them.

Another limitation is the fact that, using our solution, only web applications can have proximity-based.
In one side, this is a good fit because this is what allows to have one app to access multiple Smart Places.
On the other side, there could be developers that could use our solution to add proximity-based features in their existing native mobile apps.
This could be solved having an \gls{SDK} available for the three most used mobile \glspl{OS}, iOS, Android and Windows Phone, to allow to integrate our functionality in existing apps.

One issue with our solution is the energy consumption.
As the evaluation shows, using \gls{3G}, our mobile app, for end users, drains more than 2\% of power in just one hour. This power drain value can be unacceptable and can demotivate the user.
Unless the owners provide \gls{WiFi} \glspl{AP} in their Smart Places, this is an issue that need to be solved in order to make this solution usable.
However, using \gls{4G} the battery consumption can be better.
This data connection mean was not tested due to limitations in terms of resources available during the development of this master thesis.

%\section{Final thoughts}
%\label{sec:conclusion_final_thoughts}
% Introduced the concept of Smart Place
% Used ibeacon protocol
% Internet connection required
% Energy consumption can kill the whole idea but only using 3G
% Nothing about 4G (could be better)
% Owners should have WiFi APs
