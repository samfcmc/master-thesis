\label{chapter:solution}
% Overview about the solution
% Data model
The main goal of the solution being proposed here is to offer a tool
to develop proximity-based mobile applications.
There are already some tools available (presented in [add reference to chapter]).
However, some of them are attached to a given platform, that is, developers
need to write one proximity-based application for each platform they want
to reach.
In order to circumvent this limitation, this solution allows developers
to use the same technologies that are used for any web application (HTML, CSS
and Javascript).
