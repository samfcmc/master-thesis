\label{chapter:solution}
% Overview about the solution
% Types of users
% For each one, who he is, what he does...
% What was implemented for each one
The main goal of our solution is to assist
the development process of proximity-based mobile applications.
Before starting the description of our solution we need to take a look at three kinds of users that will be part of it:
\begin{description}
  \item[End users] are anyone with a mobile device that installs an app to scan for nearby Smart Places and interact with tags;
  \item[Owners] are responsible for managing a given place that they want to turn into a Smart Place;
  \item[Developers] develop the code for the Smart Places.
\end{description}

The Smart Places solution has a component that targets each one of the presented type of user.
There is a mobile app to allow anyone with a mobile device to use the services provided by nearby Smart Places.
Owners have a mobile app that allows them to turn the places they manage into Smart Places.
To develop these services our solution offers an \gls{API} that developers can integrate in their web applications to make them react to the presence of the user.

% What comes next
In the next section, we introduce the main components of the solution and how they relate with each other.
The solution's architecture is described in more detail in section \ref{sec:soltion_architecture}.
The Android apps are described in sections \ref{sec:solution_mobile_app_for_end_users} and \ref{sec:solution_mobile_app_for_owners}, respectively.
Then, we present the \gls{API} for developers in section \ref{sec:solution_developers_api}, from its installation to its usage.
In section \ref{sec:solution_examples}, we describe two examples of Smart Places, the Smart Restaurant and the Smart Museum, including their main features and how they contributed to the development of our Developers \gls{API}.
Finally, in section \ref{sec:solution_summary} there is a summary of the important aspects of our solution.

\section{Solution Overview}
\label{sec:solution_solution_overview}
% Introduce solution
% Smartphone
% App for owners
% App for users
% API for developers
% Beacons (Tags)
% Backend
The Smart Places solution developed in this work is composed by several components, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:solution_overview}:
\begin{description}
  \item[Beacons]
  are the small devices that will act as tags, according to our definition of a Smart Place;
  \item[Backend]
  is where all the data about Smart Places is stored, that is, that are available and the ones tht the owner has configured, information about each beacon, etc;
  \item[End Users Mobile App]
  is an Android mobile app that allows users with a mobile device \gls{BLE} enabled to have access to nearby Smart Places and to detect the beacons that belong to those Smart Places;
  \item[Owners Mobile App] is another Android mobile app that owners use to select which Smart Places they want to configure. It also allows to configure each individual beacon that belongs to a given Smart Place;
  \item[Developers \gls{API}] provides the necessary methods that developers can use to create their proximity-based services, based on the concept of a Smart Place.
\end{description}
Each mentioned component is described, in further detail, in the next sections.

\end{figure}

\section{Architecture}
\label{sec:soltion_architecture}
% Introduce architecture
% Owners/Users app similar
% Figure 1 shows...
% Explain each component
In the previous section, we described important decisions for the development of our Smart Places solution. Those decisions were taken into account while designing its architecture.
As already mentioned, we have two mobile apps, each one for a different kind of user.
One allows end users to have access to services provided by Smart Places and the other offers an interface for owners to manage their Smart Places.
Both apps need to be able to detect tags and send and receive data to and from the backend.
Between these two apps the difference is on the \gls{UI} that each one offers.
Smart Places solution is composed by the following components, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:smart_places_architecture}:
\begin{description}
  \item[Beacons]
  are the hardware used to act as tags in Smart Places;
  \item[Backend]
  is where all the data is stored, including data about each Smart Place and each tag;
  \item[Beacons Manager]
  is an abstraction of the \gls{BLE} layer.
  It offers a method to scan for nearby beacons. Once this component was created we did not need to handle the \gls{BLE} communication each time a scan was necessary;
  \item[Data Store]
  is the Backend client for the mobile apps.
  It has all the needed methods to get the information about Smart Places and tags from the beacons that were detected by the Beacons Manager;
  \item[User Interface]
  is the mean for the user to interact with the mobile app and calls the other components in order to provide the necessary features;
  \item[Smart Places Web View]
  is an instance of a Web View, available in the Android \gls{SDK}.
  This is an extension of the default Web View because it has methods to call Javascript functions of the web application that is running here;
  \item[Smart Places \gls{API}]
  is the Javascript library that allows the web applications to react to the presence of tags.
  It is described in further detail in section \ref{sec:implementation_developers_api}.
  \item[Smart Place Instance]
  is the instance of the proximity-based service developed according to the concept of Smart Place that is running inside the Web View and uses the Smart Places \gls{API} to be able to execute code when a tag is detected.
\end{description}

\begin{figure}[!ht]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth, keepaspectratio]{images/smart_places_architecture}
    \caption[Smart Places Solution Architecture]{Architecture of Smart Places Solution showing its main components}
    \label{fig:smart_places_architecture}
\end{figure}

% Explain the complete flow
% Data Store communicates with the backend
The different components interact with each other in order to provide the features for end users or owners depending on the app.
Figure~\ref{fig:smart_places_sequence} shows how the components of our architecture communicate with each other in order to provide a proximity-based service for end users.
First, the Beacons Manager is called in order to scan for nearby beacons and it returns the nearest one.
The beacon itself only broadcasts an identifier.
It does not have enough data to know which Smart Places it belongs to.
Next, the Data Store component is called in order to get the information about the Smart Places that use that beacon as a tag.
Data Store makes a request to the Backend in order to get this information.
When the Backend returns a list of Smart Places that list is used to notify the user about the Smart Places that were found.
Then, if the user touches on of the notifications a \gls{UI} with a Web View is shown.
Since each Smart Place is a web application the \gls{URL} of the Smart Place that the user previously selected, when he touched the notification, is loaded to the Web View.
After the page finishes loading, the Beacons Manager is called again to perform another scan for nearby beacons and it returns the nearest one.
The Data Store is called again but this time, to get the tag associated to that beacon that belongs to the selected Smart Place.
The data of this tag is sent to the Web View which calls the Smart Places \gls{API} allowing the web application to react to the presence of this tag.

\begin{figure}[!ht]

    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth, keepaspectratio]{images/client_app_sequence}
    \caption[Smart Places Sequence Diagram]{Sequence diagram showing the interaction between the Smart Places components}
    \label{fig:smart_places_sequence}
\end{figure}

\section{Mobile App for End Users}
\label{sec:solution_mobile_app_for_end_users}
% Who are end users
% What are the main features of the app
% Workflow (whith some screenshots)
Anyone that has a mobile device, such as a smartphone, can use the services provided by any Smart Place.
In our solution, there is an Android app distinct from the one described in section \ref{sec:solution_mobile_app_for_owners}, that notifies the user when he is nearby any Smart Place.
When the mobile device approaches any Smart Place the app notifies the user that he is near a Smart Place.
When the user touches these notifications the app shows an embedded web browser that contains a web page that can react to nearby objects, that is, beacons with meaning to the application.

After installing the app, the first time the user opens it, the app ask the user to turn on the device's bluetooth, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:screenshot_clientapp_entry}.
\begin{figure}[!ht]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth, keepaspectratio]{images/screenshots/clientapp_entry}
    \caption[Users mobile app]{First interaction with the user}
    \label{fig:screenshot_clientapp_entry}
\end{figure}
This app will scan for nearby beacons periodically.
Each time a beacon is scanned, the app shows a notification associated to a Smart Place.
If the scanning period is small, the app can constantly notify the user. Otherwise, if this period is big the user will receive less notifications.
This period also has an impact on battery consumption.
The more times the app scans for nearby beacons the more battery is drained.
According to his/her preference, our app allows the user to change the scan periods in background and foreground modes.

\section{Mobile App for Owners}
\label{sec:solution_mobile_app_for_owners}
% Who are the owners
% What are the main features of the app
% Workflow (with some screenshots)
The Smart Place owners manage one or more places where they want to provide a service to visitors in their mobile devices.
In order to make owners be able to offer this kind of services, an Android app designed for them is offered by this solution.
This app offers the folllowing features:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Get a list of all available Smart Places;
  \item Configure an instance of a given Smart Place;
  \item Delete an existing configuration of a given Smart Place;
  \item Update an instance of a given Smart Place.
\end{itemize}

In order to configure a Smart Place first, owners need to tag physical objects.
They need to deploy beacons in the right places.
Then, they use the mobile app to create an instance of a Smart Place following the steps shown in Figure~\ref{fig:screenshot_ownersapp}:
\begin{itemize}
  \item First, the app asks owners to log in.
  The app only allows log in using user's Facebook account.
  Parse \gls{BaaS} already provides integration with social networks.
  We did not need to ask for an username and password.
  \item The app shows a list of all available Smart Places that the owner can configure.
  For instance, the Smart Restaurant and Smart Museum examples described in section \ref{sec:solution_examples} are examples of Smart Places that can appear in this list;
  \item Then, the owner selects one and he can see a text explaining what that Smart Place is about;
  \item Finally, the owner just needs to type a title and a message, that will appear in the users' mobile devices notifications when they are nearby
\end{itemize}

After creating an instance of a Smart Place the owner needs to configure tags, that is, associate information to the previously deployed beacons.
This information will depend on the Smart Place.
Figure~\ref{fig:screenshot_ownersapp_configure} shows the needed steps to configure tags in an instance of a given Smart Place.
First, the owner selects the instance from the list of ones that he has created.
Then, he has access to an interface where he can manage the existing tags of that Smart Place instance.
Each Smart Place has its own management interface.
Developers are responsible for creating these interfaces, using the developers \gls{API}, introduced in section \ref{sec:solution_developers_api}.

    \caption[Configure a Smart Place Instance]{From left to right, the steps to configure an instance of a given Smart Place}
    \label{fig:screenshot_ownersapp_configure}
\end{figure}

\section{Developers API}
\label{sec:solution_developers_api}
% Why javascript api
% Who
% How to use it (with some code snippets)
Owners configure the data of a Smart Place and end users can interact with objects nearby.
But, who will add behavior to these Smart Places?
Our solution offers a way for developers to create their Smart Places.
Also, we want to avoid the user having to install one mobile app for each Smart Place.
The app for end users has an embedded web browser, so they can use any Smart Place as they would use any web application without the need to install one more mobile app.
That is why a Javascript library is part of our solution.
This way, an existing web application can use this library and make it react to nearby objects tagged with \gls{BLE} beacons.

The library was turned into an open-source project, hosted on a github repository\footnote{http://github.com/samfcmc/smartplaces-js} and it is available to install using bower\footnote{http://bower.io}, which is a tool to manage dependencies in web applications.
If a developer wants to install this library, he/she just needs to run a command, as shown in Listing~\ref{code:bower_install}

\begin{listing}[H]
  \begin{minted}[xleftmargin=.1\textwidth]{shell}
  bower install smartplaces-js --save
  \end{minted}
  \caption[Library installation using Bower]{Command to install smartplaces-js library using bower}
  \label{code:bower_install}
\end{listing}
Then, he/she just needs to include the library and use the available functions.
The library is event-based, that is, the mobile apps described in sections \ref{sec:solution_mobile_app_for_owners} and \ref{sec:solution_mobile_app_for_end_users} emit events to the library such as, a nearby beacon is detected, to the web application running inside a embedded web browser.
In this library, there is a global object, which is ``SmartPlaces'' with several methods.
All those methods need to receive a callback because because as already mentioned the library follows an event-based approach.
The reason why it is not synchronous is explained in chapter \ref{chapter:implementation}, section \ref{sec:implementation_smart_places}.
However, developers are also responsible for creating the interface to configure the Smart Place, that is, the steps that owners have to follow, as described in section \ref{sec:solution_mobile_app_for_owners} after they select the Smart Place they want.
In the part of the web app that will be accessed by owners, developers first need to initialize the library, as shown in Listing~\ref{code:smartplaces_initialization}.
\begin{listing}[H]
  \begin{minted}[xleftmargin=.1\textwidth]{javascript}
    SmartPlaces.onInit(function(smartPlaceInstance) {
      // Code after initialization of this Smart Place Instance
    });
  \end{minted}
  \caption[Javascript library initialization]{Javascript library initialization}
  \label{code:smartplaces_initialization}
\end{listing}

When the owner is using the app, described in section \ref{sec:solution_mobile_app_for_owners}, there is a button that when is touched the app scans for nearby beacons and sends an event to the javascript library.
Developers have to define the behaviour when this event is emitted, as shown in
Listing~\ref{code:smartplaces_on_beacons_scanned}.

\begin{listing}[H]
  \begin{minted}[xleftmargin=.1\textwidth]{javascript}
    SmartPlaces.onBeaconsScanned(function(beacons) {
      // Code to handle beacons that were scanned
    });
  \end{minted}
  \caption[Beacons scanned]{Defining a callback function when beacons are scanned by the mobile app for owners}
  \label{code:smartplaces_on_beacons_scanned}
\end{listing}

The argument named ``beacons'' in the callback function in \ref{code:smartplaces_on_beacons_scanned} is an array of \gls{JSON} objects, where each one has the following keys:
\begin{itemize}
  \item uuid: The \gls{UUID} of the beacon that was scanned;
  \item major: The major value, according to the ibeacon protocol;
  \item minor: The minor value, according to the ibeacon protocol.
\end{itemize}

However, there is more information about each beacon for instance, its name and its icon \gls{URL}.
To get this extra information, from a beacon \gls{JSON} object, there is a function, which usage is shown in Listing~\ref{code:smartplaces_get_beacon}, that makes a request to the backend in order to get all the information about the given beacon. This information includes a name and an \gls{URL} for an image that represents the beacon, besides the data already provided such as the \gls{UUID}, major and minor values.
Since this function makes a request to the backend, we need to pass as an argument an object with two keys:
\begin{itemize}
  \item success: Callback function when the request was successfully made and we got a response with an object that, besides the keys mentioned before, \gls{UUID}, major and minor, also got the name and icon which is an \gls{URL} that we can use to get the image of that particular beacon;
  \item error: Callback function, when the request returns an error.
\end{itemize}

\begin{listing}[H]
  \begin{minted}[xleftmargin=.1\textwidth]{javascript}
    SmartPlaces.getBeacon(beaconScanned, {
      success: function(beacon) {
        /*
        Code to handle when a beacon object was retrieved
         successfully from the backend
        */
      },
      error: function(error) {
        /*
        Code to handle when an error occurrs when trying
         to get a beacon object from the backend
        */
      }
    });
  \end{minted}
  \caption[Get beacon object]{Get beacon information from the backend}
  \label{code:smartplaces_get_beacon}
\end{listing}

After we got the beacon object with all the information, it is possible to associate a \gls{JSON} with any structure.
To do that, there is an ``associateTag'' function which usage is illustrated in Listing~\ref{code:smartplaces_associate_tag}.
We need to pass the beacon object, the object with the data that we want to associate with the beacon and another object with success and error keys, similar to what is shown in Listing~\ref{code:smartplaces_get_beacon}.

\begin{listing}[H]
  \begin{minted}[xleftmargin=.1\textwidth]{javascript}
    SmartPlaces.associateTag(beacon, data, {
      success: function(tag) {
        /*
        Code to handle when a tag is successfully
        associated to a beacon
        */
      },
      error: function(error) {
        /* Code to handle when an error occurrs trying
        to associate a tag to a beacon
        */
      }
    });
  \end{minted}
  \caption[Associate tag]{Associate a tag to a given beacon and provide custom data}
  \label{code:smartplaces_associate_tag}
\end{listing}

It is also possible to update an existing tag.
For that, developers can use the ``updateTag'' function.
Its usage is shown in Listing~\ref{code:smartplaces_update_tag}.
This function requires the existing tag object and an object with success and error keys similar to the other functions that make requests to the backend.
This function is similar to the previous one, shown in Listing~\ref{code:smartplaces_associate_tag} but instead of passing a beacon as an argument, we pass a tag object to update it with the data in the object provided as the second argument.

\begin{listing}[H]
  \begin{minted}[xleftmargin=.1\textwidth]{javascript}
    SmartPlaces.updateTag(tag, data, {
      success: function(updatedTag) {
        /*
        Code to handle when the given tag is successfully updated
        */
      },
      error: function(error) {
        /*
        Code to handle when an error occurrs when
        trying to update the given tag
        */
      }
    });
  \end{minted}
  \caption[Update an existing tag]{Update data of a given tag}
  \label{code:smartplaces_update_tag}
\end{listing}

The previously mentioned functions, are available in order to make developers able to create the interfaces for owners.
For the end users, the mobile app detects nearby tags and emit an event to the web application running inside the embedded web browser.
Developers need to define a callback function for this event.
To do that, the ``onTagFound'' can be used, as shown in Listing~\ref{code:smartplaces_tag_found}.
The tag object, which is the argument of this callback function, is the \gls{JSON} object created previously in the code illustrated in Listing~\ref{code:smartplaces_associate_tag}.

\begin{listing}[H]
  \begin{minted}[xleftmargin=.1\textwidth]{javascript}
    SmartPlaces.onTagFound(function(tag) {
      // Code to handle when the mobile app detects a tag
    });
  \end{minted}
  \caption[Defining a callback for when a tag is found]{Callback for when a nearby tag is found}
  \label{code:smartplaces_tag_found}
\end{listing}

\section{Examples}
\label{sec:solution_examples}
% Why
% Introduce each one
% Explain the main features
We have created two examples of Smart Places to see if our solution would work in practice.
% Created one example, extracted one API, applied to other example
First, we developed the Smart Restaurant.
While building this example, we wrote Javascript code to handle the events emitted by the mobile apps, described in sections \ref{sec:solution_mobile_app_for_owners} and \ref{sec:solution_mobile_app_for_end_users}.
From this code, it was possible to create a library that resulted in a complete independent project, from which, the examples depend on.
After building the first example, we developed another one which is the Smart Museum.
We defined the Javascript library as a dependency and observed that the same \gls{API} that fits the Smart Restaurant example, also was used in the other example.
Also, we avoided to develop the examples completely from the scratch.
Instead, we tried to integrate the \gls{JS} \gls{API}, described in section \ref{sec:solution_developers_api} with existing applications or \glspl{API}.

As already mentioned, two examples were created.
The first, described in section \ref{sub:solution_smart_restaurant}, is a Smart Place for restaurants to allow customers to place their orders without the need to wait.
The other one, is a proximity-based service for museums.
It allows users to have access to more information about an object that they are close to in a museum exhibition.
Its features are described in section \ref{sub:smart_museum}.

\subsection{Smart Restaurant}
\label{sub:solution_smart_restaurant}
The Smart Restaurant was the first app created to show the usage of the entire solution.
The main goal here is to allow restaurants' customers to place their orders, using their mobile devices, such as smartphones, without having to wait for an employee coming to them.
When customers arrive at this Smart Restaurant, a notification shows up in their devices with a message saying that they can place their orders using the mobile app.
Then, they touch the notification and a new \gls{UI} appears.
Now, they have access to the restaurant's menu where they can pick what they want and in the end, place their orders.
Figure~\ref{fig:smart_restaurant_app}, shows the steps that the customer follows to place an order using the mobile app. We can see from left to right that the app detects the table's number and after the sign in process several buttons appear, each one representing a family of products and there is a button in the bottom to see the complete order.
When the customer touches this button, there is a list of the complete order and a button to send the order.

Also, there is a backoffice, where employees and managers, have access to an \gls{UI} to manage the orders and the menu.
This backoffice was implemented in another master thesis\cite{SLOC}.
Our work here was to integrate our solution in this backoffice.
There was already an interface to place orders.
We changed this interface to use our Developers \gls{API}, described in section \ref{sec:solution_developers_api} to get the table's number.
We also added an option to the backoffice's \gls{UI} to manage the mapping between tables and beacons.
This integration shows the hability to use existing code, that is, our Smart Places solution can be integrated in existing applications.

\begin{figure}[!ht]

    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth, keepaspectratio]{images/screenshots/smart_restaurant_app}
    \caption[Smart Restaurant]{Steps to place an order in the Smart Restaurant app}
    \label{fig:smart_restaurant_app}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Smart Museum}
\label{sub:smart_museum}
The Smart Museum is another example of a Smart Place, that is, a proximity-based service developed using our solution.
The idea is to allow visitors of a museum to have access to information about a given object in a given exhibition using their mobile devices.
Visitors go to the museum and as they look at a given object they are notified, through the mobile app that they can get more information.
Then, when they touch in the notification, a screen appears with the information about that object that they are looking at.
Figure~\ref{fig:smart_museum_app} shows a screen, in the mobile device, after the museum's visitor has touched the notification.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth, keepaspectratio]{images/screenshots/smart_museum_app}
    \caption[Smart Museum]{Smart Museum app showing information}
    \label{fig:smart_museum_app}
\end{figure}

Instead of creating a fake museum with mock data, we used real data from a real data source.
The idea was to try to emulate the real experience.
For that, we have used data from the Walters Art Museum\footnote{http://thewalters.org}, which is a public art museum, located in Mount Vernon-Belvedere, Baltimore, Maryland.
It was founded in 1934 and its collection includes more than 30 000 objects.
The way we got the data about the collections and objects is detailed in chapter \ref{chapter:implementation}, section \ref{sub:implementation_smart_museum}.

\section{Summary}
\label{sec:solution_summary}
% Related work
% -> Proximity-based apps (BlueSentinel and BlueVIew)
% -> Context-awareness
% -> Dynamix
% Targets owners, developers and end users
% Solution overview
% -> Components (Beacons, Backend, mobile apps, API)
In this chapter we presented our Smart Places solution and its main components.
There are the beacons which act as tags in a Smart Place.
The Backend stores the data about each Smart Place and the tags.
Since our solution targets owners and end users, there is a mobile app for each one that offers features according to their needs.
Also, for developers, we introduced an \gls{API} that they can be used to create proximity-based services according to the definition of a Smart Place.

% Architecture
We introduced our architecture and its main components.
Inside the mobile apps we have the Beacons Manager which interacts with the beacons and the Data Store which is essentially a client for the Backend.
One important component is the Web View which is an embedded web browser that gives access to Smart Places that are web applications.
This allows developers to built Smart Places using web technologies such as \gls{HTML}, \gls{CSS} and Javascript.
Also, this allows users to use any Smart Place just by installing one app in their mobile devices.
The decision to support web applications is explained in further detail in the next chapter.

% Mobile App for End Users
% -> What it is
% -> Main features
The app for end users, anyone with a mobile device that can detect tags in a given Smart Place and then forward to specific functionalities.
The user needs to install the app and turn on the device's Bluetooth receiver.
Then, the app will scan for nearby beacons, in background.
When a Smart Place is found, the app notifies the user.
When the user touches a notification the app will perform a new scan but this time, to find tags that belong to that Smart Place.

% Mobile App for Owners
% -> What it is
% -> Main features
The mobile app for owners allows them to see a list of available smart places, configure an instance of a given Smart Place, delete an existing configuration or update an instance of a Smart Place they already have configured.
Owners deploy beacons in the right places and use the app to create an instance of a Smart Place and configure the tags according to what is requested by the Smart Place that he is configuring.

% Developers API
% Event based API
% -> How to install
% -> Overview of usage
Developers implement the custom behaviors of proximity-based services.
We created an \gls{API} for them to use to make the development of a Smart Place an easier process that without this \gls{API}.
Due to its asynchronous nature, each method of the \gls{API} receives a callback function.

We created also two examples of Smart Places, the Smart Restaurant and the Smart Museum.
The first allows customers of a restaurant to place their orders using their mobile devices when they arrive at the restaurant. Using the tags deployed in the restaurant, the table's number is automatically found allowing employees to know where the order comes from.
The Smart Museum allows visitors of a given museum to get information about a given object when they are in the proximity of that object.
These examples were created to demonstrate the solution in a pratical way.
