@inproceedings{Krevl2006,
abstract = {Location based services and applications are buzzwords nowadays, yet they have been around for quite some time in a variety of applications. However these applications are scarce because of the high costs associated with the positioning equipment. This paper presents different options for determining location of mobile devices such as mobile phones and Pocket PCs. It describes positioning possibilities using WiFi networks, GSM networks, Bluetooth beacons and the GPS system. Furthermore, it proposes a framework for developing distributed location based applications. The paper specifies which components comprise the framework, data structures that are used for spatial data interchange and Web services that are used for communication between components. It also describes a location aware application prototype built on top of the proposed framework. It concludes that building applications on top of the proposed framework is feasible and discusses benefits and drawbacks of this approach},

@inproceedings{dynamix,
abstract = {Today's mobile devices represent exceptional foundations for wide-area Internet of Things (IoT) applications. However, the vast heterogeneity of real-world environments makes it challenging for applications to sense, understand and adapt to the user's continually evolving context. We're investigating a new community-based approach for context-aware computing, where advanced context sensing capabilities are dynamically deployed to mobile devices as plug-ins, and are made available to applications through only a few lines of code. Towards this end, we're developing Dynamix, an open plug-and-play context framework for Android. Dynamix runs as lightweight background service on the user's mobile device, modeling context information from the environment using the device itself as a sensing, processing and communications platform. Mobile applications request context support from Dynamix using simple application programming interfaces (APIs). Dynamix automatically discovers, downloads and installs the plug-ins needed for a given context sensing task. When the user changes environments, new or updated plug-ins can be deployed to the device at runtime, without the need to restart the application or framework. Dynamix comes with a growing collection of ready-made plug-ins, and provides open software developments kits (SDKs) and a scalable repository architecture, which enable 3rd party developers to quickly create and share new plug-ins types with the community. This paper presents the Dynamix approach, describes our prototype implementation and presents promising performance evaluation results.},

The main cause of this problem is the limited available resources, including a limited number of doctors, nurses, and limited capacity and availability of medical devices. There have been attempts to alleviate the problem through various strategies. In this paper, a low-cost system was developed and tested in a public hospital with limited budget. The system utilized QR code and smartphone application to capture as-is hospital processes and the time spent on individual activities. With the available activity data, two algorithms were developed to identify two quantities that are valuable to conduct process improvement: the most congested time and bottleneck activities. The system was implemented in a public hospital and results were presented.},
