\section{Preliminary Results}
\label{sec:preliminary_results}
In Section \ref{sec:smart_restaurant_experience} we presented the
requirements, in table \ref{table:requirements}, of the overall
Smart Restaurant solution.
A prototype was implemented in order to verify those requirements.
This prototype followed the architecture described in Section
\ref{sec:solution_architecture}.
Table \ref{table:requirements_verification} shows, for each requirement,
described in \ref{sub:requirements}, if it is implemented by our prototype
and which component of our architecture is responsible for its implementation.

\input{tables/requirements_verification.tex}

As it is possible to see from the table, only one requirement was not met.
Payments using software imply concerns about security. Since this feature
involves some complexity and are not trivial to implement, we gave
a higher priority level to the other features
because they aim to reduce the time
that the customers spend waiting for someone to process their orders.
The beacon functionalities are novel whereas the payment integration is
already supported by existing restaurant solutions.
8 out of 9 requirements were implemented by our solution.
No quantitative evaluation was performed yet, neither tests with
potential users.
