  Proximity-based applications engage users while they are in proximity of
  Points of Interest (POIs).
  These apps are becoming popular among the users of mobile devices.
  Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is a technology that can be used to locate
  the user indoors.
  BLE beacons broadcast an identifier which, when read, can trigger
  different possibilities to the users.
  Some applications using this technology are emerging, in
  advertising for retail, and many others.
  In this paper, we present a solution for smart restaurants that allows
  customers to interact with a mobile app
  that communicates with beacons placed at each table.
  This app enables a richer customer experience for placing orders or
  asking for the check with fiscal data.
  Restaurants' waiters receive the orders and know immediately what the customer
  wants and which table they have to deliver to.
  The service can be improved by avoiding errors, such as forgetting
  something that the customer asked for, and
  allowing customers to get their orders faster without the need to have a
  waiter physically present to take their orders.
